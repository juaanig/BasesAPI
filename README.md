# BasesAPI
# _Basic API for authentication and CRUD implementation_


This is a basic API developed with .NET 8 and integrated with SQL Server to support records.
You can see that the API has the basic elements to be used as a reference in a larger project."

"You will find basic directories such as:

- Controllers
- Models
- Services

as well as important files:
- Program.cs
- appsettings.json

If you want to implement the API directly, remember to modify these files according to your criteria and needs.
